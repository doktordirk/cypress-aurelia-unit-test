# Cypress Aurelia Unit Test

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silbinarywolf/cypress-aurelia-unit-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silbinarywolf/cypress-aurelia-unit-test)
[![npm Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cypress-aurelia-unit-test.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-aurelia-unit-test)

This is a library designed to feel like the official [aurelia/testing](https://github.com/aurelia/testing) library but instead it is built to work with Cypress.
The purpose of this module is so that components can be visually unit tested as close to reality as possible, ie. in a browser rather than in NodeJS with a virtual DOM.

[Gleb Bahmutov](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test) for their Cypress React Unit Test library. It helped me figure out how to get styles working quickly.
